### Core Django Applications

**Tracking App**: Handles email and attachment tracking logic, pixel generation, and event recording. This app manages the core tracking functionality including generating unique tracking URLs and processing tracking events.

**Emails App**: Manages email composition, sending, and integration with email service providers. This includes handling different email backends and supporting multiple SMTP configurations.

**Analytics App**: Processes tracking data and generates reports and dashboards. This app aggregates tracking events and provides insights into email performance metrics.

**Webhooks App**: Handles incoming webhook notifications from email service providers and external integrations. This ensures real-time processing of email delivery and interaction events.

**API App**: Provides RESTful API endpoints for programmatic access to tracking functionality. This enables third-party integrations and mobile applications.

## Email Tracking Implementation

### Pixel Tracking Method

The primary tracking method uses invisible 1x1 pixel images embedded in HTML emails. When recipients open emails, their email client requests the tracking pixel from the server, triggering an open event. The implementation requires:

- Unique encrypted tracking URLs for each email/recipient combination
- Lightweight image serving endpoint that logs tracking data and returns a transparent pixel
- Support for multiple image formats (PNG, GIF) for maximum compatibility
- Proper HTTP caching headers to ensure accurate tracking

### Link Tracking Implementation

All links in tracked emails must be rewritten to proxy through the tracking system. The system intercepts clicks, logs the interaction, and redirects users to the original destination. This requires:

- URL rewriting logic that preserves original link functionality
- Fast redirect processing to minimize user experience impact
- Geographic and device detection from click events
- Link click correlation with email open events

### Read Receipt Integration

The system should support standard email read receipts as a fallback tracking method. While not universally supported, read receipts provide explicit confirmation when available and should be offered as an optional tracking enhancement.

## Attachment Tracking Specifications

### Cloud Storage Integration

Attachment tracking requires replacing traditional email attachments with trackable cloud storage links. The implementation must:

- Upload attachments to secure cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
- Generate time-limited, tracked access URLs for attachments
- Monitor download events and viewing duration for supported file types
- Support various file formats including PDF, Word documents, PowerPoint presentations

### Security and Access Controls

Attachment tracking must implement robust security measures:

- Encrypted attachment identifiers to prevent unauthorized access
- Configurable access permissions (view-only, download-enabled)
- Audit logs for all attachment interactions
- Option to revoke attachment access after sending

### File Type Support

The system must support tracking for common business file formats:

- PDF documents with page-level viewing analytics
- Microsoft Office documents (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- Image files with viewing duration tracking
- Video files with playback analytics

## Database Schema Design

### Core Tracking Models

The database schema must efficiently handle high-volume tracking data while maintaining query performance. Essential models include:

**Email Model**: Stores email metadata, sender information, and tracking configuration
```python
class Email(models.Model):
    sender = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    recipients = models.JSONField()
    subject = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    body_html = models.TextField()
    body_text = models.TextField()
    tracking_id = models.UUIDField(unique=True, default=uuid.uuid4)
    sent_at = models.DateTimeField()
    tracking_enabled = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    attachment_tracking = models.BooleanField(default=False)
```

**TrackingEvent Model**: Records all tracking interactions with optimized indexing
```python
class TrackingEvent(models.Model):
    email = models.ForeignKey(Email, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    recipient_email = models.EmailField()
    event_type = models.CharField(max_length=50)  # open, click, download
    timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    ip_address = models.GenericIPAddressField()
    user_agent = models.TextField()
    location_data = models.JSONField(null=True)
    metadata = models.JSONField(default=dict)

    class Meta:
        indexes = [
            models.Index(fields=['email', 'recipient_email']),
            models.Index(fields=['timestamp']),
            models.Index(fields=['event_type']),
        ]
```

**Attachment Model**: Manages tracked file attachments
```python
class Attachment(models.Model):
    email = models.ForeignKey(Email, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    filename = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    file_size = models.BigIntegerField()
    file_type = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    storage_path = models.CharField(max_length=500)
    tracking_url = models.URLField(unique=True)
    access_count = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
```

### Performance Optimization

Database performance is critical for high-volume email tracking. Required optimizations include:

- Strategic indexing on frequently queried fields (email_id, timestamp, recipient)
- Partitioning large tables by date for historical data management
- Connection pooling and query optimization for Django ORM
- Consider read replicas for analytics queries

## Security and Privacy Compliance

### GDPR Compliance Requirements

Email tracking involves processing personal data and must comply with GDPR regulations. Required implementations:

- Explicit consent collection before tracking activation
- Clear privacy policy disclosure of tracking practices
- Data subject rights implementation (access, deletion, portability)
- Lawful basis documentation for all data processing activities

### Data Protection Measures

The system must implement comprehensive security controls:

- Encryption of tracking identifiers and sensitive data
- HTTPS enforcement for all tracking endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization for all user data

- Role-based permissions for different user types
- API key management for programmatic access
- Session management and secure logout procedures

## Custom Email Backend Implementation

### Django Email Backend

The system requires a custom Django email backend that intercepts outgoing emails to add tracking elements. The implementation must:

```python
from django.core.mail.backends.smtp import EmailBackend as SMTPBackend

class TrackingEmailBackend(SMTPBackend):
    def send_messages(self, email_messages):
        for message in email_messages:
            if hasattr(message, 'enable_tracking') and message.enable_tracking:
                message = self.add_tracking_elements(message)
        return super().send_messages(email_messages)

    def add_tracking_elements(self, message):
        # Add tracking pixel and rewrite links
        # Generate unique tracking identifiers
        # Store email in tracking database
        return modified_message
```

### SMTP Integration

Support for multiple SMTP providers ensures reliable email delivery:

- Gmail/Google Workspace integration with OAuth2 authentication
- Microsoft Exchange/Office 365 compatibility
- Third-party email services (SendGrid, Mailgun, Postmark)
- Custom SMTP server configuration for enterprise deployments

## API Design and Integration

### RESTful API Specification

The API must follow REST principles and provide comprehensive tracking functionality:

**Email Tracking Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/v1/emails/` - Send tracked email
- `GET /api/v1/emails/{id}/stats/` - Retrieve tracking statistics
- `GET /api/v1/emails/{id}/events/` - List tracking events

**Attachment Tracking Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/v1/attachments/` - Upload trackable attachment
- `GET /api/v1/attachments/{id}/stats/` - Attachment interaction data
- `DELETE /api/v1/attachments/{id}/` - Revoke attachment access

### Webhook Implementation

Incoming webhooks from email service providers require secure handling:

```python
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt
from django.http import JsonResponse
import hmac
import hashlib

@csrf_exempt
def email_webhook(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Verify webhook signature
        signature = request.headers.get('X-Signature')
        if not verify_webhook_signature(request.body, signature):
            return JsonResponse({'error': 'Invalid signature'}, status=400)

        # Process webhook data
        data = json.loads(request.body)
        process_email_event(data)

        return JsonResponse({'status': 'success'})
```

### Rate Limiting and Throttling
